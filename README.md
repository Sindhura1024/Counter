## 🧮 Counter Project – Description

The **Counter Project** is a beginner-friendly web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It demonstrates the fundamentals of **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **styling** in front-end development.  

The app provides a simple interface where users can:
- Increment the counter value using a button
